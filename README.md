This is an ongoing project so all files are not openly available some files re private and will be made available after grading is complete

Primarily, Fortran is used for obtaining analytical and nmerical solutions for 1D adiabatic equations using different numerical schemes. The reprt will compare these and highlight the issues and positives.

Issues faced in fortran were primarily regarding precision, and useing successive do loops to accurately model periodic boundries.
Note no part of the code or report should be reused or reproduced without the permission of the author as the author is still working on this assignment.
It is a part of his Grading scheme hence it the files in the repo should be used for demonstration purpose only
